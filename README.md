✨ Project 1: Main Subjects
This project was my introduction to C#. I explored the basic structure of a program and learned how to print messages to the console using the Console.WriteLine() command. 🌟✨

📌 Project 2: Variables
I worked with different data types such as int, string, and double. This project taught me how to declare, initialize, and manipulate variables effectively. 🔢🎯

⚖️ Project 3: Making Decisions
Here, I learned how to implement decision-making logic using if, else if, and else statements. This allowed me to create programs that adapt to various conditions. 💡🧠

🔄 Project 4: Loops
I explored iterative programming using for, while, and foreach loops. This helped me automate repetitive tasks and improve efficiency in handling large datasets. 🔁📊

✨ Project 5: Loops with Stars
In this fun project, I applied loops to create patterns with stars (*) in the console. It was a creative way to reinforce my understanding of nested loops. 🌌⭐

🧩 Project 6: Arrays
This project focused on arrays, where I learned to store and manage multiple values in a single data structure. I also used loops to iterate over array elements. 📦🔄

🎓 Project 7: Foreach Loop
I deepened my understanding of the foreach loop by creating an exam system simulation. I calculated students’ averages and determined their pass/fail status. 📘🎯

🛠️ Project 8: Methods
I improved code organization by creating reusable methods. These methods took parameters, performed operations, and returned results, making my code cleaner and more modular. 🔧📐

🗄️ Project 9: Database
This project introduced me to database operations. I connected to a database using SqlConnection and executed queries with SqlCommand. The application allowed users to select tables and view data dynamically. 🛢️📂

This progression represents the foundation of my C# journey, building up from core programming concepts to more advanced topics like database management! 🚀
